![Meetup](https://github.com/DiSCoBGU/Preprocessing/raw/master/meet2.png)

For the Second meetup on 8th April

## Let's refine the model and get more insights
### Agenda

* Improve our linear regression model (feature selection and parameter tuning)
* We will explore the different data preprocessing techniques and their pros. and cons.
* Feature transformation and feature engineering
* How linear regression performs better than deep learning for house pricing competition?
