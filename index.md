### Agenda

* We will practice what we already discussed including
* Different data preprocessing techniques
* Feature Selection approaches
* Improve our linear regression model (parameter tuning)
* Feature transformation and feature engineering

### Future meetups
* Revision on Feature Selection approaches, Parameter tuning (available as kernel series for prepractice)
* Unsuppervised methods
